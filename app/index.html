              <h3>Joe Stramonine</h3>
              <em>Drums, Vocals</em>
            </header>
            <p>
              Joe Stramonine has been active in music for over 40 years and has performed in multiple genres in that span. Joe started as many do, playing in bands through high school with his neighborhood schoolmates.
            </p>
            <p>
              His first band was called the Generation Gap and lasted about 4 years, then in the 70's and early 80's Joe and his wife played in a top 40 band called Evolushun and then a harder hitting rock group Fortune.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forwarding to 1983 he and his wife Lee formed the country group Shortbread which performed in several venues around the Rochester area and opened for some national acts such as Lionel Cartwright and others popular at the time. The married duo then pursued a national career and produced an album in Nashville that yielded 2 national releases one of which reached #7 on the independent country national charts. They also performed for 2 years in a row at the well known Nashville music festival Fan Fair and also appeared on the Nashville Network multiple times.
            </p>
            <p>
              Shortbread ended in 1995 and Joe put music down for awhile to enjoy more home and family interests. From 1996 to 2000 Joe picked it back up again and performed with several groups which included playing drums and singing for Private Drive and Centre Stage, then became lead singer for Orient Express and even did a stint as front man for the Legendary Dukes.
            </p>
            <p>
              All this must have rubbed off a little as Joe's son Cory grabbed the baton and is currently front man for the popular local group Guy Smiley. Joe and Lee still enjoy performing together for special events but Joe feels very fortunate to have been chosen to perform with Main Street East and is looking forward to the coming year and beyond with this fine group of musicians.

              Lee Stramonine started singing solo performances as a child in the elementary school and church. In high school she joined a rock band where she met her husband Joe. After high school she attended Nazareth College for music.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years Lee and her husband Joe have performed together in several bands and venues. Lee began writing music and was published by Black and White Music in Nashville. One of her songs has been displayed in the Smithsonian Institute. Joe and Lee recorded several of her songs as duets in Nashville and were signed to the AMI label. They had two single releases nationally and overseas which did well on the independent label charts. They appeared twice on National television and performed at the world renowned "Fan Fair" in Nashville. Lee also sings with a local trio of ladies performing some classic secular music and gospel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lee and her husband Joe are very blessed to have 2 children and 5 grandchildren. Their son Cory has carried on the family tradition of music being the lead singer for the local group "Guy Smiley". Lee is thrilled to be a part of the Main Street East band.
